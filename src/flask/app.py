class Flask(App):
    """The flask object implements a WSGI application and acts as the central
    object.  It is passed the name of the module or package of the
    application.  Once it is created it will act as a central registry for
    the view functions, the URL rules, template configuration and much more.

    The name of the package is used to resolve resources from inside the
    package or the folder the module is contained in depending on if the
    package parameter resolves to an actual python package (a folder with
    an :file:`__init__.py` file inside) or a standard module (just a ``.py`` file).

    For more information about resource loading, see :func:`open_resource`.

    Usually you create a :class:`Flask` instance in your main module or
    in the :file:`__init__.py` file of your package like this::

        from flask import Flask
        app = Flask(__name__)

    .. admonition:: About the First Parameter

        The idea of the first parameter is to give Flask an idea of what
        belongs to your application.  This name is used to find resources
        on the filesystem, can be used by extensions to improve debugging
        information and a lot more.

        So it's important what you provide there.  If you are using a single
        module, `__name__` is always the correct value.  If you however are
        using a package, it's usually recommended to hardcode the name of
        your package there.

        For example if your application is defined in :file:`yourapplication/app.py`
        you should create it with one of the two versions below::

            app = Flask('yourapplication')
            app = Flask(__name__.split('.')[0])

        Why is that?  The application will work even with `__name__`, thanks
        to how resources are looked up.  However it will make debugging more
        painful.  Certain extensions can make assumptions based on the
        import name of your application.  For example the Flask-SQLAlchemy
        extension will look for the code in your application that triggered
        an SQL query in debug mode.  If the import name is not properly set
        up, that debugging information is lost.  (For example it would only
        pick up SQL queries in `yourapplication.app` and not
        `yourapplication.views.frontend`)

       :data:`SERVER_NAME` does not implicitly enable it.

                            of the `static_folder` folder.
    :param static_folder: The folder with static files that is served at
        ``static_url_path``. Relative to the application ``root_path``
        or an absolute path. Defaults to ``'static'``.
    :param static_host: the host to use when adding the static route.
        Defaults to None. Required when using ``host_matching=True``
        with a ``static_folder`` configured.
    :param host_matching: set ``url_map.host_matching`` attribute.
        Defaults to False.
    :param subdomain_matching: consider the subdomain relative to
        :data:`SERVER_NAME` when matching routes. Defaults to False.
    :param template_folder: the folder that contains the templates that should
                            be used by the application.  Defaults to
                            ``'templates'`` folder in the root path of the
                            application.
    :param instance_path: An alternative instance path for the application.
                          By default the folder ``'instance'`` next to the
                          package or module is assumed to be the instance
                          path.
    :param instance_relative_config: if set to ``True`` relative filenames
                                     for loading the config are assumed to
                                     be relative to the instance path instead
                                     of the application root.
    :param root_path: The path to the root of the application files.
        This should only be set manually when it can't be detected
        automatically, such as for namespace packages.

           Setting ``use_debugger`` to ``True`` without being in debug mode

        the only indication of an AssertionError or other exception will be a

        An *endpoint* is the name of a URL rule, usually added with

        view function. A route defined in a :class:`~flask.Blueprint`

        endpoint.

        In some cases, such as email messages, you want URLs to include
        the scheme and domain, like ``https://example.com/hello``. When
        not in an active request, URLs will be external by default, but

        domain to use. :data:`APPLICATION_ROOT` and
        :data:`PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME` should also be configured as
        needed. This config is only used when not in an active request.

        Functions can be decorated with :meth:`url_defaults` to modify
        keyword arguments before the URL is built.

        If building fails for some reason, such as an unknown endpoint
        or incorrect values, the app's :meth:`handle_url_build_error`
        method is called. If that returns a string, that is returned,
        otherwise a :exc:`~werkzeug.routing.BuildError` is raised.

        :param endpoint: The endpoint name associated with the URL to
            generate. If this starts with a ``.``, the current blueprint
            name (if any) will be used.
        :param _anchor: If given, append this as ``#anchor`` to the URL.
        :param _method: If given, generate the URL associated with this

        :param _scheme: If given, the URL will have this scheme if it
            is external.
        :param _external: If given, prefer the URL to be internal
            (False) or require it to be external (True). External URLs
            include the scheme and domain. When not in an active
            request, URLs are external by default.

            rule. Unknown keys are appended as query string arguments,
