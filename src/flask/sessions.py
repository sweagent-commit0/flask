    useful defaults which you don't need to change.

    The session object returned by the :meth:`open_session` method has to
    provide a dictionary like interface plus the properties and methods
    from the :class:`SessionMixin`.  We recommend just subclassing a dict

    :meth:`make_null_session` to create a session that acts as replacement
    if the session support cannot work because some requirement is not
    fulfilled.  The default :class:`NullSession` class that is created
    will complain that the secret key was not set.

    is to assign :attr:`flask.Flask.session_interface`::

    Multiple requests with the same session may be sent and handled
    concurrently. When implementing a new session interface, consider
    whether reads or writes to the backing store must be synchronized.

    request is opened or saved, it will occur in the order that requests
    begin and end processing.
